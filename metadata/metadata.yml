name: Identifying regions of importance in wall-bounded turbulence through explainable
  deep learning
description: Despite its great scientific and technological importance, wall-bounded
  turbulence is an unresolved problem in classical physics that requires new perspectives
  to be tackled. One of the key strategies has been to study interactions among the
  energy-containing coherent structures in the flow. Such interactions are explored
  in this study for the first time using an explainable deep-learning method. The
  instantaneous velocity field  obtained from a turbulent channel flow simulation
  is used to predict the velocity field in time through a  U-net architecture.  Based
  on the predicted flow, we assess the importance of each structure for this prediction
  using the game-theoretic algorithm of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This
  work provides results in agreement with previous observations in the literature
  and extends them by revealing that the most important structures in the flow are
  not necessarily the ones with the highest contribution to the Reynolds shear stress.
  We also apply the method to an experimental database, where we can identify completely
  new structures based on their importance score. This framework has the potential
  to shed light on numerous fundamental phenomena of wall-bounded turbulence, including
  novel strategies for flow control.
